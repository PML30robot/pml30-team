	\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 17:00-21:30 \newline
	\textit{\textbf{Preview:}} The main purpose for current meeting was to figure out how the modules of simple robot should look and how they will be developed. \newline \newline
	\textit{\textbf{Modules:}}

  \begin{table}[H]

		\begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\linewidth}|p{0.7\linewidth}|p{0.1\linewidth}|}
			\hline
			Module & Solution & Label \\
			\hline
			Wheel base & 6 standard wheels with 6 DC motors. The center of gravity is between second pair of wheels; corner wheels are equidistant from the center of gravity. & chassis \\
			\hline
			Heaviness & Robot should be as light as possible to afford gear ratio for speed 2:1 on drive motors. & chassis \\
			\hline
			Elevator for debris & Crank elevator with one degree of freedom. & elevator \\
			\hline
			Bucket for debris & Bucket with turning cover which will close entry inside the bucket to prevent scoring elements from accidental falling out & bucket \\
			\hline
			Slopes for collecting debris & To increase collecting area on both sides of the bucket will be placed slopes & gripper \\
			\hline
			Separator for debris & Turnable beam before the bucket, which prevents balls from getting into the bucket in it's lower position (5cm from floor). & gripper \\
			\hline
			Beam for scoring autonomus alpinists & L-shaped beam turning by servo. Alpinists placed in small bucket on the remote side of the beam. & alpinists \\
			\hline
