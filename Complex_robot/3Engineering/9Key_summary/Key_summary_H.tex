					Tasks & Ability \\
					\hline
					Score climbers into shelter in autonomous period. & Yes. \\

					Stay in beacon repair zone at the conclusion of autonomous period. & Yes. \\
					\hline
					Climb on mountain in autonomous period. & No. \\
					\hline
					Block the opponent's autonomous movement. & No. We consider that blocking is unfair. \\

					Score zip-line climbers in tele-op period. & Yes, first and second ones. \\
					\hline
					Score debris in floor goal. & Yes. \\
					\hline
					Score debris in every mountain goal. & Yes. \\
					\hline
					Stay fully in low zone at the conclusion of tele-op period. & Yes. \\
					\hline
					Stay in second or top zone or pull-up at the conclusion of tele-op period. & No. \\

					We can score 10 cubes ($5 cubes \cdot 2 times$) into the second goal instead of top if it would be pre-discussed with ally. & 90 & 100\\

				\begin{tabular}{|p{0.5\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}|}
					\hline
					Situation & Action \\
					\hline
					The autonomus program didn't run. & Score climbers into shelter in tele-op period. \\
					\hline
					Scoring debris into mountain goals is impossible due to break. & Score debris into floor goal. \\
					\hline
					Our ally lost ability of scoring debris into mountain goals in case he was to score debris into the top goal. & Firstly, we ask ally if we can score debris into the top goal instead of them. If he confirms that we can perform his game objective, we start scoring debris into top goal as it gives more points. If he rejects the suggestion (if, probably, alliance robot cann't leave the mountain), we continue performing our game objective \\
