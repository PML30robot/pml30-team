There was created a moving mount for one of the ribs at the elevator (figure \ref{Elevator3.4}).

It was also developed a prototype of a mechanism for grasping the hurdle at the ramp. The construction of the transfer between the servo and the hooks will prevent the servo from breaking down (figure \ref{Hooks1.2}).
