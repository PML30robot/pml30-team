There was installed a servo for powering the mechanism for shifting the bucket. Next, there were held the cables (figure \ref{Shiftbuc2.4}, \ref{Shiftbuc2.5}). Then, the mechanism was tested. It worked ok.

The cables for the extracting of the elevator were held (figure \ref{Winch2.5}, \ref{Winch2.6}).

There was installed a ramp for debris. The brushes were finished (figure \ref{Gripper2.2}).

There were installed motor controllers and a servo controller. The wiring wasn't finished yet (figure \ref{Controllers1.3}).
