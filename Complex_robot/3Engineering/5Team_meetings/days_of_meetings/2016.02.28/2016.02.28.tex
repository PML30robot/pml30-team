\subsubsection{28.02.2016}
\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 14:00-21:00 

This day was day of discussing FTC Russia Open competitions. Problems of robot and way of their solving were discussed.

    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.12\linewidth}|p{0.35\linewidth}|p{0.38\linewidth}|}
 	  \hline
 	  Problem type & Problem & Solution \\
 	  \hline
 	  Breakdowns (fatal) & Elevator's slats break & New construction of elevator \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Rope on the elevator tears & Correct stucking of rope inside slats. Study ropes \\
      \hline
      & Turning over because of high center of mass	& Problem can stay \\
 	  \hline
 	  Breakdowns (can be fixed in match) & Balls stays inside the bucket & Make bucket's height more than 10cm \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Elevator pulls out because of fast movement	& 2nd rope for folding in \\
 	  \hline
 	  Low speed & Low speed of elevator pulling out and bucket shifting	& The same speed of shifting. Bigger cylinder or plastic gears \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Cover is inside the scoring bucket & Bucket is upper in new construction \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Bucket shifts only with fully pulled out elevator	& Bucket is above the elevator in new construction \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Hard to move cubes away from mountain & New module \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Cubes are throwed out by gripper & Use chquered and overlapped tubes. Find the best phase shifting of gripper's axises \\
 	  \hline
 	  & Impossible to get 5th cube without taking 6th & Problem can stay \\
 	  \hline
 	  Construction impossibility & No all clear signal turning mechanism & No solution\\	
 	  \hline
 	  & Alpinists throwing is impossible in autonomous & No solution \\
 	  \hline
 	  & No pulling up	& No solution\\

  These problems seemed to be hard to solve and improve other mechanisms because of many details in construction of robot and very little space inside the robot, also it had some problems that couldn't be solved without huge changes in construction of robot. So the new concept of robot was created. New models development tasks were spread between team members.
