During the matches it was found out that the "All Clear" signal fixed tighter that we expected and it required strong force to turn it. Our mechanism for pushing the baton was not strong enough to turn the baton on the official field. Due to this fact, it was decided to remove the mechanism for pushing the "All Clear" signal from the robot.
