\subsubsection{26.11.2015}
\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 17:00-21:30 \newline
Today we received the parcel with the original field. We started assembling it.
The slats were assembled of 3 35cm furniture rails each and installed onto the carriage. The angle between direction of extracting of the rails and the surface amounted to $22.5^\circ$
