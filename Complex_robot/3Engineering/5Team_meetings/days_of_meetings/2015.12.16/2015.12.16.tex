The mechanism for shifting the bucket was recreated with relation to the last version. In contrast, in the new version there were applied longer slats (40 cm), that will provide enough offset of the bucket. Also, the mount of the mechanism was made of aluminium profile instead of TETRIX parts to save weight (figure \ref{Shiftbuc2.1}, \ref{Shiftbuc2.2}, \ref{Shiftbuc2.3}).
