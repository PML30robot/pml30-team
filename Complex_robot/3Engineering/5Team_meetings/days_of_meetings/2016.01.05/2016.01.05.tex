The mechanism for shifting the bucket was finished.

The assembling of the new version of the mechanism for scoring autonomus alpinists was started (figure \ref{Alpinists2.1}, \ref{Alpinists2.2}, \ref{Alpinists2.3}).

2 standard TETRIX motors at the winch were replaced with 3 NeveRest AndyMark motors (figure \ref{Winch2.8}). Firstly, it 2 times increased torque at the coil (3 AndyMarks give torque of $3 \cdot 25 = 75 kg \cdot cm$, while 2 standard - only $2 \cdot 20 = 40 kg \cdot cm$). Secondly, it raised the reliability of the construction, as the AndyMark motors can cope with stalling for a long time (about 2 minutes), so they will not break down if the movement of the elevator is blocked.
