Today it was decided that because the new robot is not ready we will participate at the competition FTC Dutch Open with the old robot. Due to this decision, our team would stop working on the new robot before the competition finished. 

The main aim for the following week before the FTC Dutch Open (1-2 April) is to solve all the problems in old robot and prepare it for the competition.
