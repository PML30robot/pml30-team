It was created a prototype of a twoside full-extracting furniture slat (figure \ref{Shiftbuc3.1}). The reason was to replace the construction with 2 furniture slats used in the mechanism for shifting the bucket with 1 rail which can move in both directions.

The ordinary 30 cm furniture slat was improved so that it could be extracted to its full length in both directions. The result of the experiment was successful (figure \ref{Shiftbuc3.2}, \ref{Shiftbuc3.3}).
