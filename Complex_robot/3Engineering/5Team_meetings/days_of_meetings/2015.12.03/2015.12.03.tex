Today the mechanism for shifting the bucket was installed onto the robot. It was mounted to the top pair of slats.
The bucket was installed onto the mechanism for shifting bucket.
There were also created brushes for collecting debris on the gripper.
To connect servos which are installed on the elevator there were manufactured special wires. They were made of telephone wire by soldering servo connectors. Unfortunately, it was investigated that these wires have too high resistance (9 Ohmes each), so it was impossoble to power standard servos by them. However, continious rotation servos worked with these wires with no problem (possibly because of higher inner resistance).
