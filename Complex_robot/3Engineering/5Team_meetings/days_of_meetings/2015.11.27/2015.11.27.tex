\subsubsection{27.11.2015}
\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 17:00-21:30

The work piece of the bucket for debris was cut out of the pet (figure \ref{Bucket0.1}). It was no time to craft the bucket at this meeting.

There were installed angles onto the elevator (figure \ref{Elevator1.5}). These angles will be used for installing blocks.
