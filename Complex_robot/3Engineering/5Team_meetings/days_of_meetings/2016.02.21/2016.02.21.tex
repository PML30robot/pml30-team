\subsubsection{21.02.2016}
\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 10:00-17:00 

It was the third day of the competition. We got 2nd place at the conclusion of qualification matches, so our team was a head of a final alliance. 

We won semi-final and lost final match, so we won the “Alliance-Finalist” award. We won the “Inspire Award”, so we got a quotation for the FTC World Championship.
