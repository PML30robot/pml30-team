The hooks were installed onto a mechanism for grasping the hurdle (figure \ref{Hooks1.6}, \ref{Hooks1.7}, \ref{Hooks1.8}). 

Next, it was tested without powering the servo. The construction worked ok.

There was found a problem in the wheel base. The holes for middle wheels were drilled out because of friction with the wheels' fixations (figure \ref{Wheelbase1.10}). 

The wasted beams were replaced with new ones. In order to prevent the appearance of this problem in future, there were installed bronze collars into the holes, in which the axles of middle wheels rotate (figure \ref{Wheelbase1.11}).

The bucket was installed onto the robot and it's servos were connected to the controller (figure \ref{Bucket1.4}).
