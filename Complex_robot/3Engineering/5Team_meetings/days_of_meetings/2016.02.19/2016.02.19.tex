\textit{\textbf{Time frame:}} 12:00-23:00 

It was the first day of the competition â€¦ . There were no matches, so we had time to prepare the robot.

Firstly, the plexiglass protection was mounted to the robot and the sticker was glued on it (figure \ref{Decor1.2}, \ref{Decor1.3}).

Secondly, it was created the protection which prevented wires from the elevator from getting into the winch (figure \ref{Protection1.4}).

Thirdly, it was created the protection which prevented wires from the core power module from getting into the winch (figure \ref{Protection1.5}).

\end{figure}

Lastly, it was created a device for the prevention of the engagement between the mount of the bucket and the slats (figure \ref{Protection1.6}).

It was revealed that protection for wheels scratches the field when the robot attempts to climb on the mountain and this prevents robot from climbing. Furthermore, the protection touches the field while the robot is on the mountain which means that the robot in not fully supported by the ramp (figure \ref{Protection1.7}). So, it was decided to remove the protection.
