 It was assembled the prototype of the axis with coils (figure \ref{Winch4.1}). This prototype was used to find the best way of connecting parts to each other with screws. It was quite difficult to calculate this in Creo Parametric. 
 
 It was also assembled a case of the winch (figure \ref{Winch4.2}).
